Logistic regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms for binary classification. This is because it is a simple algorithm that performs very well on a wide range of problems.

Logistic Function
Before we dive into logistic regression, let’s take a look at the logistic function, the heart of the logistic regression technique.

The logistic function is defined as: transformed = 1 / (1 + e^-x)
Where e is the numerical constant Euler’s number and x is a input we plug into the function.
Logistic Regression Assumptions
1.Data is free of missing values
2.the predicant variable is binary(only accepts two values) or ordinal(a categorical variable with ordered values)
3.All predictors independent of each others
4.there at least 50 observations per predictor variable(to ensure reliable results)
5.The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.

Logistic Regression Model
The logistic regression model takes real-valued inputs and makes a prediction as to the probability of the input belonging to the default class (class 0).
If the probability is > 0.5 we can take the output as a prediction for the default class (class 0), otherwise the prediction is for the other class (class 1).


##Comparing Logistic Regression with Other Models
Advantages of logistic regression:

1.Highly interpretable (if you remember how)
2.Model training and prediction are fast
3.No tuning is required (excluding regularization)
4.Features don't need scaling
5.Can perform well with a small number of observations
6.Outputs well-calibrated predicted probabilities

Disadvantages of logistic regression:
1.Presumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the response
2.Performance is (generally) not competitive with the best supervised learning methods
3.Can't automatically learn feature interactions
